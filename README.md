# Social and Business Connections in the 1912 New York City Art Market

## Background

This project is part of the [Getty Provenance Index's](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/search.html) “The History of Collecting and Museum Formation in the US, the Role of Knoedler” project, which seeks to identify key attributes for art collectors in anticipation of performing a social network analysis to identify potential shared ties. 

Network analysis provides a better understanding of the history of collecting in the United States during the Gilded Age and expands a focus beyond major collectors, such as Frick, Morgan, and Huntington, to demonstrate the value of data-driven approaches. This topic is explored through the narrow scope of the 1912 New York art market and art collectors’ shared participation in museum boards, social clubs, and business dealings.
